    <p class="p_text">1. My Foolish Heart - A jazz arrangement by Simon Cetinic, composed by Victor Young (I was a bit stuffed up at the time of singing). One of the first jazz compositions I made. I played it as an accompanyment in various jazz clubs in Toronto. Editted through Ableton. <br><br> 2. Danny Boy - One of the newest compositions in my repitoire. I combine rootless voicings, a walking bassline, and reharmonization in one piece to showcase my skills (just over a year) in self taught jazz piano. Editted through Ableton. <br><br> 3. First Art Piece - I took a photo of what I considered to be a dynamic landscape and used Adobe Illustrator to create a vector inspired photo-realistic image. I degraded the opacity on root colors to add a fading effect. In the end, I enjoy it as a study of photo-realistic(esq) graphics with surealist colors. <br><br> 4. Asset canvas - A canvas displaying assets used in an abandoned project being made in unity. The assets themselves were designed in Adobe Illustrator. <br><br> 5. Animations and Game Design - Some animations that were created in Adobe Illustrator and coded using C# into unity. The gifs were created using Premiere Pro. <br><br> 6. - 8. Website Projects - Designed and created from scratch using html, css, and javascript. Descriptions for each are on the website. <br><br> 9. - 12. Photography - Various photographs taken and digitally editted in Adobe Photoshop. <br><br> 13. Data Analysis - A data analysis of COVID-19 in Toronto and what affects the spread of it. Modelled using the random forest regression in Python.</p>
